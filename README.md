🥗 Food Nutrient Analysis Dashboard

A Power BI dashboard analyzing nutritional composition across food items for health, diet, and macro-nutrient insights.

📘 Project Overview

The Food Nutrient Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive breakdown of nutrient values from a food dataset.
The goal is to help users understand:

Calorie distribution

Macronutrient relationships

Cholesterol, sugar, protein patterns

Nutrient density across food categories

High/low nutrient foods for diet planning

This end-to-end project transforms raw data into an interactive Power BI dashboard published on Power BI Service.

📂 Dataset

Source: Kaggle – Food Nutrient Dataset
(You can update this with the direct dataset link if needed.)

The dataset includes:

Food item descriptions

Calories

Proteins, Sugars, Carbohydrates, Fat

Sodium, Saturated Fat, Cholesterol

Category-level breakdown

🎯 Objectives
